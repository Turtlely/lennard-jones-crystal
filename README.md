# Lennard-jones-crystal
simulation of a crystal (Or any phase of matter) with particles following Lennard-jones potentials.
The symplectic Euler method is used for solving the differential equations.

Simulation parameters can be adjusted for different scenarios.
- tstep
- Lennard-Jones parameters A and B.
- Initial particle configuration (A function is included to generate grids of particles automatically)
- window size

## Projectile launched at grid of particles
